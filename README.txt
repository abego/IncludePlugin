ABOUT INCLUDEPLUGIN

abego.IncludePlugin is a plugin for TiddlyWiki (http://www.tiddlywiki.com/).
Include other TiddlyWikis in your (main) TiddlyWiki, link to included tiddlers, 
view them in your (main) TiddlyWiki, without opening another TiddlyWiki. 
Even "search" looks for included tiddlers.

A great way to share tiddlers, to speed up "save changes" and to keep your 
TiddlyWikis small.


SMALLER TIDDLYWIKIS

Other than "imported" tiddlers, included tiddlers are not copied into your main
TiddlyWiki. This keeps your individual TiddlyWikis small.

Since your TiddlyWikis will become smaller (if you reorganize your TiddlyWikis 
using the IncludePlugin) also "save changes" becomes faster. You may even 
consider switching on "AutoSave" or "SaveBackups" again.


SHARING TIDDLYWIKIS

You may include one TiddlyWiki in several other TiddlyWikis. Changes you make 
to this shared TiddlyWiki are automatically reflected the next time you open 
the other TiddlyWikis, without any extra „import“ step or so.
